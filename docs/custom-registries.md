# Custom registries

It's now possible to change the registries used by the `install-tool` and `prepare-tool` commands.
This can be done by url replacements.

## General configuration

The number of `URL_REPLACE_*_FROM` and `URL_REPLACE_*_TO` environment variables must match.
Theses variables are case sensitive.
The numbers will be processed in numerical order and can have gaps.

```Dockerfile
FROM containerbase/base

ENV URL_REPLACE_5_FROM=https://storage.googleapis.com/dart-archive/channels/stable/release/
ENV URL_REPLACE_5_TO=https://artifactory.proxy.test/virtual/dart-archive/

ENV URL_REPLACE_0_FROM=https://download.docker.com/linux/static/stable/
ENV URL_REPLACE_0_TO=https://artifactory.proxy.test/virtual/docker-com/

# renovate: datasource=github-releases packageName=moby/moby
RUN install-tool docker v24.0.2

# renovate: datasource=docker
RUN install-tool dart 2.18.0
